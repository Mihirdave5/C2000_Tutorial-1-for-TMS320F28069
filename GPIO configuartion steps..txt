1-Important Register's 
   i. (GPAMUX1 ,GPAMUX2 ,GPBMUX1 ,GPBMUX2 ,AIOMUX1 ,GPACTRL ,GPBCTRL ,GPACTRL2 ,GPAQSEL1 ,GPAQSEL2 , GPBQSEL1 ,GPBQSEL2 ,GPADIR ,GPBDIR ,AIODIR ,GPAPUD ,GPBPUD ,GPADAT ,GPBDAT ,AIODAT ,GPASET ,GPACLEAR ,GPATOGGLE ,GPBSET ,GPBCLEAR ,GPBTOGGLE ,AIOSET ,AIOCLEAR ,AIOTOGGLE ,GPIOXINTnSEL).
   ii. For further explanation of register's refer GPIO section of Technical reference Manual of TMS320F28069.

2-Select GPIO as per operation to be performed such as single GPIO is mulltiplexed with different operation's such as  GPIO ,EPWM, SCI etc, Therefore assign appropriate value to GPAMUX1,GPAMUX2,GPBMUX1,GPBMUX2.
